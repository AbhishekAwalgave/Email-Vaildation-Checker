📧 Email Validation Script using Python (CLI-Based)
📌 Project Description:
Email Validation System built using Python. The script checks whether an entered email address is valid based on a series of simple rules — such as length, structure, allowed characters, and proper placement of "@" and ".". It is ideal for Python beginners learning conditional logic, string manipulation, and input handling.

✅ Validation Rules Implemented:
Email must be at least 6 characters long.
The first character must be an alphabet.
The email must contain exactly one "@" symbol.
The email must contain a "." at either the 3rd or 4th position from the end (e.g., .com or .in).
No whitespace characters allowed.
No uppercase letters allowed.
Only the following characters are allowed:
Alphabets (a–z)
Digits (0–9)
Symbols: _, ., and @

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Language: Python 3.x
Interface: Command Line (Terminal)
